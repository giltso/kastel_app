# Shifts System Implementation Issues

**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - ISSUES IDENTIFIED  

## üéØ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Database Schema:** Complete with 4 tables (shifts, shift_assignments, shift_swaps, golden_time_requests)
- **Backend API:** Full CRUD operations and capacity management in `convex/shifts.ts`
- **UI Components:** CreateShiftModal, ShiftCard, shifts page with status indicators
- **Navigation:** Shifts tab added to worker portal
- **Permission System:** Manager-only creation, worker self-assignment
- **Status Calculation:** Real-time bad/close/good/warning indicators based on capacity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### 1. **Calendar Integration Missing**
- **Problem:** Shifts are not displayed on calendar view
- **Impact:** Users can't see shifts alongside regular events
- **Requirement:** Semi-transparent shift blocks on calendar with overlap capability

### 2. **Assignment Functionality Broken**
- **Problem:** Workers and managers cannot actually sign in/assign to shifts
- **Current State:** UI exists but backend assignment calls may be failing
- **Impact:** Core functionality not working for end users

### 3. **Non-Recurring Shifts Not Supported**
- **Problem:** All shifts must be recurring - no one-time shift option
- **Current:** `recurringDays` is required array, not optional
- **Need:** Single-day shifts for special events, coverage, etc.

### 4. **Day of Week Order Issue**
- **Problem:** Weekly toggles start Monday-Sunday instead of Sunday-Monday
- **Current:** ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"]
- **Required:** ["sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday"]
- **Scope:** Update in schema, UI components, and all references

### 5. **Redundant Events Tab**
- **Problem:** Events tab serves no purpose if shifts handle operational scheduling
- **Decision:** Replace Events tab with Shifts tab entirely
- **Impact:** Simplifies navigation and user mental model

### 6. **Calendar Assignment Integration Missing**
- **Problem:** Assignment process requires separate shifts page
- **Requirement:** Click-to-assign directly from calendar view
- **UX Goal:** Seamless workflow for managers and workers

### 7. **Worker Hours Reporting Missing**
- **Problem:** No way to track/report worker hours across date ranges
- **Requirements:**
  - **Summary Report:** Total hours number for date range
  - **Calendar View:** Daily hours displayed on each calendar date
  - **Date Range Selector:** From/to date picker for reports

## üìã PRIORITIZED ACTION ITEMS

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Fix Assignment System** - Workers/managers must be able to assign to shifts
2. **Calendar Integration** - Display shifts semi-transparently with events
3. **Calendar Assignment UI** - Click-to-assign from calendar view

### Medium Priority (User Experience)  
4. **Day Order Fix** - Sunday-first week order throughout system
5. **Non-Recurring Shifts** - Support one-time shifts
6. **Navigation Simplification** - Replace Events tab with Shifts tab

### Low Priority (Reporting)
7. **Worker Hours Reports** - Date range reporting with calendar view

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Database Changes Needed
- Make `recurringDays` optional in shifts schema
- Update day enum order to start with Sunday
- Consider adding `isRecurring` boolean to shifts table

### Backend Updates
- Fix assignment mutation calls
- Add non-recurring shift support
- Implement hours calculation queries

### Frontend Updates  
- Integrate shifts into calendar component
- Update all day-of-week components to Sunday-first
- Replace Events navigation with Shifts
- Add hours reporting components

## üìÖ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Debug and fix assignment functionality** (blocking core usage)
2. **Implement calendar-shift integration** (critical UX)
3. **Update day-of-week ordering** (consistency fix)
4. **Test end-to-end shift workflows** (validation)

The foundation is solid, but these issues prevent production use. Next session should focus on making the core assignment functionality work reliably.
