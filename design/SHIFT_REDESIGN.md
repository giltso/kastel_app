## üéØ V2 SHIFT SYSTEM OVERVIEW


### **Core Design Principles:**

1. **Operational Visibility Focus**: Primary goal with secondary reporting and flexibility
2. **Dual Approval Workflows**: Both worker and manager must consent to assignments
3. **Action-Oriented Interface**: Overview section shows items requiring immediate attention
4. **Unified Scheduling**: All time-based activities (shifts, courses, rentals) in single interface
5. **Role-Based Defaults**: Interface adapts to user's primary responsibilities
6. **üÜï Flexible Worker Accommodation**: System adapts to different work arrangements without clutter
7. **üÜï Human Oversight Maintained**: Information-driven decisions with manager control
8. **üÜï Hourly Population Framework**: Requirements defined by hour, not fixed shift types

## üîß FLEXIBLE SHIFT ARCHITECTURE

### **Problem Statement:**
Current operational pain points requiring systematic solutions:

#### **Worker Arrangement Complexity:**
- **Full-day workers**: Opening to closing (8 AM - 8 PM)
- **Split-shift workers**: Work morning, long break, return evening
- **Partial workers**: Morning-only (8 AM - 2 PM) or afternoon-only (12 PM - 8 PM)
- **Offset workers**: Start 2 hours after opening, end 2 hours before closing

#### **Dynamic Population Requirements:**
- Different staffing needs throughout the day (quiet periods vs. peak hours)
- Opening procedures require specific worker count
- Lunch rush needs additional coverage
- Closing procedures require adequate staff

#### **Manager Decision Complexity:**
- Currently requires human problem-solving for scheduling decisions
- No systematic way to visualize coverage gaps
- Difficult to accommodate worker preferences while meeting operational needs

### **Solution: Population-Based Flexible Framework**

#### **1. Hourly Population Requirements Template**
Instead of creating multiple shift types, define **hourly staffing requirements**:

```typescript
Daily Operations Template Example:
Store Hours: 08:00 - 20:00

Hourly Staffing Requirements:
08:00-09:00: 2 workers (opening procedures, register setup)
09:00-12:00: 1 worker (quiet morning period)
12:00-15:00: 2 workers (lunch rush, customer traffic)
15:00-18:00: 3 workers (peak afternoon, deliveries, customers)
18:00-19:00: 2 workers (evening sales, prep for close)
19:00-20:00: 2 workers (closing procedures, cleanup)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visibility of when more/fewer workers are needed
- Flexible assignment accommodates any work arrangement
- Easy identification of coverage gaps and over-staffing

#### **2. Manager-Driven Assignment System**
Managers retain full control over assignments with enhanced information:

**What the system provides:**
- Clear hourly staffing requirements
- Visual timeline showing gaps and overlaps
- List of available workers with basic preferences noted
- Simple assignment interface with drag-and-drop capability
- Real-time coverage calculation and gap warnings

**What managers control:**
- Which worker gets assigned to which hours
- How to handle worker preferences and constraints
- Break scheduling and special arrangements
- Last-minute changes and coverage decisions

#### **3. Timeline Visualization Framework**
Unified vertical timeline for LUZ interface integration:

```
Manager's Assignment Interface Example:
     Time ‚îÇ Required ‚îÇ Current Workers
    ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
     8 AM ‚îÇ    2     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Sarah ‚ñà‚ñà Mike
     9 AM ‚îÇ    1     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Sarah [Gap!]
    10 AM ‚îÇ    1     ‚îÇ [Empty - Critical!]
    11 AM ‚îÇ    1     ‚îÇ [Empty - Critical!]
    12 PM ‚îÇ    2     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Mike [Gap!]
     1 PM ‚îÇ    2     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Lisa [Gap!]
     2 PM ‚îÇ    2     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Lisa ‚ñà‚ñà John
     3 PM ‚îÇ    3     ‚îÇ ‚ñà‚ñà Lisa ‚ñà‚ñà John [Gap!]
    ‚îÄ And so on through closing ‚îÄ
```

#### **4. Worker Self-Service Opportunities**
Workers can identify and request suitable additional hours:

**Worker Interface Shows:**
- Their confirmed schedule for the week
- Available extra hours that fit their typical pattern
- Simple request system for additional coverage
- Clear status tracking for their requests

**Example Worker Opportunities:**
```
Extra Hours Available:
üü° Wednesday 12PM-6PM - "Good fit for you!"
   (Matches your afternoon preference)
üü° Friday 2PM-4PM - "Optional overtime"
   (Extends your normal shift by 2 hours)
```

## üóÇÔ∏è V2 DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN - SIMPLIFIED HUMAN OVERSIGHT

### **1. Shift Templates (shifts_v2) - Population-Based**
*Defines hourly population requirements instead of fixed shifts*

```typescript
shifts_v2: {
  _id: Id<"shifts_v2">,
  _creationTime: number,

  // Basic Information
  name: string,                    // "Daily Operations", "Weekend Coverage"
  description?: string,            // Optional details about operational requirements
  type: "operational" | "maintenance" | "educational" | "special",

  // Store Operation Hours
  storeHours: {
    openTime: string,              // "08:00"
    closeTime: string,             // "20:00"
  },

  // Hourly Population Requirements (KEY CHANGE)
  hourlyRequirements: {
    hour: string,                  // "14:00" (24-hour format)
    minWorkers: number,            // Minimum required workers
    optimalWorkers: number,        // Ideal staffing level
    notes?: string,                // "Peak customer period", "Opening procedures"
  }[],

  // Recurrence Pattern
  recurringDays: DayName[],        // ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday"]
  isActive: boolean,               // Enable/disable this template

  // Management
  createdBy: Id<"users">,          // Manager who created template
  lastModified: number,            // Track template changes
  color?: string,                  // Hex color for calendar display
}
```

### **2. Shift Assignments (shift_assignments_v2) - Flexible Hours**
*Individual worker assignments with flexible hour ranges*

```typescript
shift_assignments_v2: {
  _id: Id<"shift_assignments_v2">,
  _creationTime: number,

  // Core Assignment Data
  shiftTemplateId: Id<"shifts_v2">,// Reference to population template
  workerId: Id<"users">,           // Assigned worker
  date: string,                    // "2025-09-16" (specific date)

  // Flexible Hour Assignment (KEY CHANGE)
  assignedHours: {
    startTime: string,             // "08:00"
    endTime: string,               // "14:00" - Manager assigns flexible ranges
  }[],

  // Break Management (Optional)
  breakPeriods?: {
    startTime: string,             // "12:00"
    endTime: string,               // "13:00"
    isPaid: boolean,               // true/false for paid breaks
  }[],

  // Assignment Metadata
  assignedBy: Id<"users">,         // Manager who made assignment
  assignedAt: number,              // Timestamp of assignment

  // Simple Status (scheduling only)
  status: "assigned" | "confirmed" | "cancelled",

  // Notes
  assignmentNotes?: string,        // Manager's assignment notes
}
```

### **3. Worker Hour Requests (worker_hour_requests_v2) - Self-Service**
*Workers requesting additional hours or time off*

```typescript
worker_hour_requests_v2: {
  _id: Id<"worker_hour_requests_v2">,
  _creationTime: number,

  // Request Details
  workerId: Id<"users">,           // Worker making request
  shiftTemplateId: Id<"shifts_v2">,// Which operational template
  date: string,                    // "2025-09-16"

  // Request Type and Hours
  requestType: "extra_hours" | "time_off" | "schedule_change",
  requestedHours?: {
    startTime: string,             // "12:00" - for extra hours
    endTime: string,               // "18:00"
  },

  // Request Context
  reason?: string,                 // "Need overtime", "Doctor appointment"
  priority: "low" | "normal" | "urgent",

  // Approval Status
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "denied" | "cancelled",
  reviewedBy?: Id<"users">,        // Manager who reviewed
  reviewedAt?: number,             // Timestamp of review
  reviewNotes?: string,            // Manager's response notes

  // Auto-created assignment (if approved)
  createdAssignmentId?: Id<"shift_assignments_v2">,
}
```
