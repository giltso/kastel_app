# Shifts System Implementation Issues

**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - ISSUES IDENTIFIED  

## areas in need of major improvement

### 1. **Calendar Integration**
- week view is not consecutive, segmented instead
- shifts need to contain other events inside them. 
  - some events are exempt, but that is the defalult
- the shift tab is not syncronized with the LUZ tab in tools and uses
- no easy viewing of who is on shift
- no switch button between workers 

### 2. **Assignment Functionality Broken**
- assignment by manager should pop the user out of possible assignments.
- assignments should look like toggles instead of like forms.
- signing in should not be possible if already on shift instead should have a switch out button.

### 3. **Non-Recurring Shifts Not Yet Supported**
- shifts should differ from events in regular use case.
  - reucuring shifts should be implamented as reucuring events
  - if a change to a specific shift is done, it should be treated as a unique event that replaces the shift
  so the database should of both in the same system. 
  - shifts should exist in the database only for 2 weeks in advance, and if there are assigned workers should be saved indefenatly.


### minor polish (UI Polish & Optimization) âœ… COMPLETED 2025-09-06

1. âœ… Center Courses Tab Layout - Fix left-leaning alignment issue (Fixed justify-between to justify-center with proper ordering)
2. âœ… Remove Courses Tracking - Simplify to recommendation-only skill levels (Schema design already supports this)
3. âœ… Hide Professional Help from Non-Pros - Remove visibility for guests/non-pro users (Already implemented via access_pro_help permission)
4. âœ… Weekly toggles start Monday-Sunday instead of Sunday-Monday (Updated week calculation to use Monday-first logic)
5. âœ… Replace the location of the filtration module on the LUZ tab to be above the navigation (Moved filter section above calendar navigation)
6. âœ… Make the navigation tools a bit bigger, and slightly more pronounced (Changed from btn-sm to btn-lg, improved styling)
7. âœ… Change the color of a over-full shift to yellow, similar to a not quite full shift (Updated 'warning' status from blue/info to yellow/warning)
