# Calendar-Centric Architecture Redesign

**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Status:** 🎉 PROJECT COMPLETE - ALL PHASES IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED

## 🎯 VISION STATEMENT

Transform the application from a dual Events/Calendar system to a unified Calendar-centric architecture where all operational workflows, approvals, and interactions happen within the calendar interface, eliminating redundant navigation and streamlining user experience.

**This document represents a comprehensive roadmap for transforming the application architecture. Each phase builds on the previous one while maintaining system stability and user productivity. The unified calendar-centric approach will significantly improve user experience while simplifying the overall system architecture.**

## 📋 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### What We Have Now
- **Dual Interface**: Separate Events tab and Calendar tab with overlapping functionality
- **Fragmented Workflows**: Users must navigate between tabs for related operations
- **Approval Bottleneck**: Managers must use Events tab for approvals, then Calendar for scheduling
- **Cognitive Load**: Users must understand two different interfaces for similar concepts
- **Data Duplication**: Same information displayed differently in multiple places

### What Works Well (To Preserve)
- **Role-based Access Control**: Solid permission system across all user types
- **Unified Data Model**: Events and shifts share similar schema patterns
- **Calendar Integration**: Recently implemented shifts display works better than before

## 🏗️ PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

### Core Principle: Calendar as Single Source of Truth
All temporal data (events, shifts, approvals, assignments) lives and is managed through calendar interface. other portals are meant to enhance the experience, not be the main form of interaction.

### New Interface Structure
```
Application Layout:
├── Calendar (PRIMARY - absorbs all Events functionality)
│   ├── Multi-view Support (Month/Week/Day)
│   ├── Inline Creation & Editing
│   ├── Approval Workflows (Manager-specific)
│   ├── Assignment Management
│   └── Status Management
├── Specialized Hubs (Secondary)
│   ├── Requests Hub (to be made)
│   ├── Tickets Hub  (to be made)
│   ├── Tools/Rentals Hub
│   ├── Courses Hub
│   └── Forms Hub
└── User Profile & Settings
```

## 🔄 FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

### Calendar Tab Enhancement

#### For All Users
- **Unified View**: Events and shifts display together with clear visual distinction
- **Quick Actions**: Right-click or long-press context menus for common operations
- **Smart Filtering**: Role-based filtering that shows relevant items only
- **Search Integration**: Global search across all calendar items
- **Time Navigation**: Seamless navigation between date ranges

#### Manager-Specific Features
- **Approval Workflow**: Pending items highlighted with approval action buttons
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select for batch approvals/rejections
- **Assignment Dashboard**: Overlay showing staffing levels and gaps
- **Notification Center**: Embedded alerts for items requiring attention
- **Analytics View**: Toggle for capacity planning and utilization metrics

#### Worker-Specific Features
- **Self-Service**: Direct assignment to available shifts
- **Swap Requests**: Initiate shift swaps directly from calendar
- **Status Updates**: Mark progress on assigned events/shifts
- **Personal View**: Filter to show only personal assignments

### Eliminated Events Tab Benefits
- **Reduced Navigation**: No tab switching for related operations
- **Contextual Decisions**: See scheduling impact when approving items
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Create → View → Approve → Assign in single interface
- **Improved UX**: Single mental model for all temporal operations

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Backend Consolidation

#### 1.1 API Restructuring
```typescript
// Unified Calendar API Design
export const getUnifiedCalendarData = query({
  args: { 
    startDate: v.string(),
    endDate: v.string(),
    view: v.union(v.literal("month"), v.literal("week"), v.literal("day")),
    filters: v.optional(v.object({
      showEvents: v.optional(v.boolean()),
      showShifts: v.optional(v.boolean()),
      showTools: v.optional(v.boolean()),
      showPendingOnly: v.optional(v.boolean()),
    }))
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Unified query combining events, shifts, approvals
    // Role-based filtering and data enrichment
    // Return structured data for calendar rendering
  }
});

// Unified approval APIs
export const approveCalendarItem = mutation({
  args: {
    itemId: v.string(),
    itemType: v.union(v.literal("event"), v.literal("tool_rental")),
    approve: v.boolean(),
    reason: v.optional(v.string())
  }
});

export const bulkApproveCalendarItems = mutation({
  args: {
    items: v.array(v.object({
      itemId: v.string(),
      itemType: v.union(v.literal("event"), v.literal("tool_rental"))
    })),
    approve: v.boolean()
  }
});
```

#### 1.2 Data Model Enhancements
- **Unified data structure**: All calendar items return consistent format with approval metadata
- **Role-based filtering**: Server-side permission filtering in unified query
- **Bulk operation support**: Implement in bulkApproveCalendarItems mutation
- **Permission flags**: canApprove, canEdit, pendingApproval flags in unified API

#### 1.3 Permission System Updates
- **Consolidated permissions**: Unified permission logic in calendar_unified.ts
- **Calendar-specific checks**: canApprove, canEdit flags computed server-side
- **Role-aware validation**: Manager vs worker permissions properly enforced

### Phase 2: Frontend Architecture Overhaul

#### 2.1 Calendar Component Redesign
```typescript
// Enhanced calendar with embedded workflows
interface UnifiedCalendarItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'event' | 'shift' | 'tool_rental';
  status: string;
  approvalRequired: boolean;
  canEdit: boolean;
  canApprove: boolean;
  pendingApproval: boolean;
  // ... full metadata included
}

// Calendar approval actions
const handleApproveCalendarItem = async (item: any, approve: boolean) => {
  await approveCalendarItem({ itemId: item.id, itemType: item.type, approve });
};

// Bulk operations
const handleBulkApprove = async (items: any[], approve: boolean) => {
  await bulkApproveCalendarItems({ items: bulkItems, approve });
};
```

#### 2.2 New UI Components
- **DraggableEvent Enhanced**: Unified display with approval buttons and selection checkboxes
- **Inline Approval Buttons**: Check/X buttons directly on pending items for managers
