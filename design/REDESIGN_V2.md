## üèóÔ∏è V2 Core System Architecture

### **1. LUZ System - Unified Scheduling Hub**

*Primary focus: All event scheduling through single interface*

**LUZ System Scope & Priority:**
- **V2 Primary**: Shift Management (operational scheduling and documentation)
- **V2 Secondary**: Tool rentals and course integration (existing systems)
- **Future**: Vanilla events (general scheduling after core systems proven)

**Core Goals:**
- Present available shifts to workers
- Handle shift requests and assignments
- Provide unified interface for all time-based activities
- Allow managers to oversee and approve scheduling 

#### **Staff Roles & Permissions**
- **Staff (All)**:
  - [ ] *Define basic shift system access* 
    - all staff interacts with the shift systme through the same tab on the site, called LUZ.
    - this is the main hub for all actions regarding staff schedualing. 
    - the tab has 3 main features:
      - **top** filter field on that marks what is seen by the current user
      - **left** a overview section that shows schedualed events depending on the filtration
      - **right** a calander that visually allows for work assigment.  
    - **Permission Model**: Staff members see "public" (permissionless) information within staff context
      - Base Staff (no tags): See shift times and basic details, but not assignments or private info
      - Future extensibility: New staff tags can unlock specific LUZ functions (maintenance, security, reception, accounting staff)
      - Access is modular - each piece of information has its own permission requirement   

- **Workers**:
  - [ ] *Define available shift viewing* 
    - workers can see the shifts and see the population status for them
    - workers see by default their own status on shifts, meaning the main way for them to interact is see all available shifts and click on the shift they wanna join and make a reuqest to join.
    - workers have permission to check who is on every shift, but that is not the base interacion. 
  - [ ] *Define shift request capabilities*
    - Workers request assignment to shifts via simple action requiring authorization
    - **Empty Shift Request**: Direct to manager for approval
    - **Worker Switch Request**:
      - Worker A requests to switch with Worker B
      - Request queues in system (no in-app notifications in V2)
      - External notification: DM sent to Worker B outside the site
      - Worker B checks LUZ for pending requests
      - If Worker B approves ‚Üí goes to manager for final approval
      - If Worker B denies ‚Üí request ends immediately (no manager involvement)
  - [ ] *Define own assignment status*

- **Managers** (inherits Worker permissions +):
  - [ ] *Define shift assignment approval workflows*
    - shifts requests are collected for a few days, and the approval needs to be handled either on singular basis or with bulk actions
    - there should be a warning system in place to prevent overbooking 
    - the filteration system should be rubust and allow the manager to check the assignments easly on multiple parameters such as specific worker or time period
  - [ ] *Define worker assignment capabilities*
    - should allow a manager to assign a worker to a shift. in this case the worker needs to approve the assignment. 
    - after approval should interact 
  - [ ] *Define shift scheduling permissions*
    - managers can create and edit shifts as a basic tool. most shifts should be a recuring event that should be created and populated with minimal interfacing
    - in special cases, one time shfts can occur and they need to be easy to manage.
      - a non recurring shift can be made by editing an instance of an existing shift, by changing some parameter like number of workers or start time. in this case it should not affetct the recurring shift. 
      - it is not yet decided if the ability to change shifts is manager only. 
  - [ ] *Define reporting access*
    - the shift tool should create reports on hours worked. the reports can be made for each worker, for any specified time period. the formating and styling will be handeled later.

#### **LUZ Interface Specifications**

**Complete LUZ interface specifications documented in [LUZ_CALENDAR_REDESIGN.md](LUZ_CALENDAR_REDESIGN.md)**

**High-Level Overview:**
- **70/30 Split Layout**: Overview section (left 30%) + Calendar timeline (right 70%)
- **Three Views**: Day, Week, Month - each optimized for different user workflows
- **Role-Adaptive Interface**: Different permissions and capabilities for Base Staff, Workers, Instructors, Managers
- **Real-time Updates**: Live capacity indicators, assignment tracking, conflict detection

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Dual approval workflows (manager‚Üîworker consent required)
- Population-based shift system (hourly requirements, not fixed shifts)
- Unified calendar for shifts, courses, and tool rentals
- Mobile-responsive with touch-friendly interactions

üëâ **See [LUZ_CALENDAR_REDESIGN.md](LUZ_CALENDAR_REDESIGN.md) for complete specifications including:**
- Detailed drag-and-drop logic
- Timeline rendering algorithms
- Mobile responsiveness specs
- Performance optimization strategies
- Interactive element specifications 

- **Instructors**:
  - [ ] *Define course-related shift access*
    - courses are events that are not shifts. therefor they should show on the LUZ. courses have public information such as time and enrollment status, and have protected info such as who is enrolled and where is the course.  
  - [ ] *Define if instructor can also request worker shifts*
    - Instructor role provides course management permissions only
    - If instructor also has Worker tag: gains full worker shift permissions (additive system)
    - Base Instructor (no Worker tag): sees only public shift timing for course scheduling context

#### **Core Shift System Functionality**

**Complete shift system design documented in [SHIFT_REDESIGN.md](SHIFT_REDESIGN.md)**

**High-Level Summary:**
- **Population-Based Framework**: Hourly staffing requirements (not fixed shift slots)
- **Flexible Worker Accommodations**: Full-day, split-shift, partial, offset arrangements
- **Dual Approval Workflows**: Manager assigns ‚Üí worker approves OR worker requests ‚Üí manager approves
- **Worker Self-Service**: Request additional hours, time off, schedule changes
- **Shift Swapping**: Worker-to-worker swap requests with manager final approval

üëâ **See [SHIFT_REDESIGN.md](SHIFT_REDESIGN.md) for complete specifications including:**
- Detailed workflow diagrams
- Database schema (shifts_v2, shift_assignments_v2, worker_hour_requests_v2)
- Assignment algorithms and validation logic
- Reporting specifications
- Success metrics and future enhancements

### **2. Tool Rental System**
*Keeping existing implementation with refinements*

#### **Customer Roles & Permissions**
- **Customers**:
  - [ ] *Define rental browsing permissions*
  - customers should be able to view the whole collection based on public info and search specific tools by parameters.
  - customers should see the price of items, but the site does not work with money at all and they wont be able to pay on the site.
  - tools have public data, like current availability, and private data such as problems or history of rentals that is not public. 
  - [ ] *Define booking capabilities*
    - customers should be able to request a booking for a tool, the request is pending manager approval
    - after permission is granted, the customer is allowed to take the tool and the manager can start a rental ,that has both the customer and all workers have access to.
    - while the tool is not returned, the site calculates the cost.
    - after returning the tool and setteling the cost the rental is over and stored as history for both the tool and the customer.  
  - [ ] *Define account management*
    - customer needs to put private info into account to create acountability in case of theft. 
    - customer manager approval *on account* in order to be allowed to make rentals at all **important- treat as customer role tag**

- **Staff**:
  - [ ] *tool management permissions*
      - Tool management actions currently part of Worker permissions
      - Future: Specific tool handler role may be added (TBD in tool rental design work) 
  - [ ] *Define inventory management permissions*
    - staff/tool permission role is allowed to see all tools a status and be create tickets for tool issues and fixes needed
    - workers can view rental events and filter by approvla level if needed. 
  - [ ] *Define rental processing workflows*
    - rental uccurs when customer chooses a tool and request use for an allotted time slot, through a form in the site.
    - the request is processed and checked to see if it colides with other approved requests.
      - if theres a collide, help find a solution via constraining time slot to allow.
      -  if there is no collide, move to manger aproval.
    - manager reviews the request and approves or denies 
      - if apporves the user takes the tool, when taken a worker should interact with a rental event to show that it started.
      - if not approved, trminate the process. 
    - after the tool is used and returned, a worker marks as returned and the rental event stops. 



#### **Core Functionality**
- [x] **KEEP**: Existing rental booking system
- [x] **KEEP**: Inventory management
- [ ] *Define any needed simplifications*
    - tools have owners, when damage uccurs to a tool the owner is informed. 
    - if a tool is late or reported to be damaged by otehr users, notify owner.
    - if tool reported late or out of commission, notify staff and show on site. 
---

### **3. Educational Meetings (Courses)**
*Keeping existing implementation with refinements*

#### **Customer/Student Roles & Permissions**
- **Students**:
  - [ ] *Define course browsing permissions*
    - students are just normal customers, no need for special permissions. 

 
  - [ ] *Define enrollment capabilities*
      - students can see all courses (for now) and can request enrollement to any course.
      
  - [ ] *Define progress tracking*
    - not a main feature. should keep what courses were done for user for future feture development.

- **Instructors**:
  - [ ] *Define course management permissions*
    - Every course has a writer (owner) and optional helpers, all are instructors
    - Course writer: Instructor who creates the course (gains writer permissions automatically)
    - Helper instructors: Additional instructors assigned to assist with course
    - Only course writer can edit course details and manage helper instructors
    - Any instructor for the specific course can approve enrollments

  - [ ] *Define student management capabilities*

#### **Core Functionality**
- [x] **KEEP**: Existing course enrollment system
- [x] **KEEP**: Course management
- [ ] *Define any needed simplifications*

Legend: H=Home, C=Courses, L=LUZ, T=Tool Rental

### **Role Requirements & Conditionals**

**Base Roles (no conditionals):**
- **Guest**: No authentication required (unauthenticated state)
- **Staff**: Requires authentication
- **Customer**: Requires authentication

**Staff Tags (conditional requirements):**
- **Worker**: Requires Staff
- **Instructor**: Requires Staff
- **Course Writer**: Requires Instructor (which requires Staff)
- **Tool Handler**: Requires Staff (required for tool rental access)
- **Manager**: Requires Worker (which requires Staff)

**Customer Tags (conditional requirements):**
- **Student**: Requires Customer + successful enrollment in specific course
- **Tool Renter**: Requires Customer + successful booking approval for specific tool

### **Future Consideration: Staff as Customer**
**Edge Case for Future Implementation**: Staff members may need Customer access for personal use

**Additive Permission Approach:**
- Customer + Staff + Worker: Should have access to both staff and customer functions
- No role restrictions, only additive permissions
- System design supports multiple role combinations

**Future Scenarios:**
- Worker renting tools for personal use
- Instructor enrolling in courses as a student
- Staff members booking services for personal needs

*Note: Additive permission system should handle this naturally without special restrictions.*
