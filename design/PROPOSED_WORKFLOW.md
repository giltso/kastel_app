# V2 Implementation Work Packets

**Status:** 📋 PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
**Context:** V2 Redesign - Systematic implementation approach for shift system and LUZ integration

---

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Migration Approach: Clean Slate**
Based on V2 redesign decision, we'll deploy to a new Convex instance and selectively import data rather than migrate existing complex systems. This allows us to:
- Start with clean database schema optimized for V2
- Avoid complex data transformation from V1 systems
- Preserve critical data (users, tools, courses) while rebuilding shift system
- Test V2 system in parallel with V1 before final switch

   - [ ] Auto-approval when both actions occur simultaneously
   - [ ] Conflict resolution when multiple workers request same shift

2. **Switch Request System Testing:**
   - [ ] Worker A initiates switch with Worker B
   - [ ] Worker B receives external notification and responds
   - [ ] Manager receives request and makes final decision
   - [ ] Assignment updates correctly for both workers

3. **Capacity Management Testing:**
   - [ ] Prevent assignments exceeding maximum capacity
   - [ ] Warning system for understaffed shifts
   - [ ] Bulk approval with capacity validation
   - [ ] Override capabilities for emergency staffing

4. **Cross-System Integration Testing:**
   - [ ] Unified LUZ display with all item types
   - [ ] Search functionality across multiple systems
   - [ ] Filter interactions affecting multiple data sources
   - [ ] Calendar performance with complex data sets

### **Performance Benchmarks:**
