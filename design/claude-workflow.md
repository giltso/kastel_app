this is a doc meant to help cladue with integrating well with the project.


## workflow ## 

generally, when starting a session you will be directed to read these files:

- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- a specific feature implamenteation doc

the goal is to get a good understanding of the enviroment in which the development will happen. to do this effectively the docs should be fairaly short, and give good info for the current session. so some docs will include a practical part that needs to be read, and then a documentation part that is unimportant for the current work. anyway, always read last 2 sessions to get a good idea where we are.  

priodically, after finishing major changes, update the feature doc used during the session. at the end of a session, update the PROJECT OVERVIEW on session on all changes. if approching 5 hour limit, update docs before doing anything else.

if asked to make a new file for a specific feature, use the SHIFT_IMPLAMENTATION_ISSUES as a template.
