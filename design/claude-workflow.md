# claude project integration #

## general goal ## 

this is a doc meant to help us with integrating well on this project. 

updating the state of the project is massively important, and helps getting results that span multiple sessions.


## session workflow ## 

the goal is to get a good understanding of the enviroment in which the development will happen. to do this effectively the docs should be fairaly short, and give good info for the current session.

generally, when starting a session you will be directed to read these files:

### PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md ###

read always, update on finish and after major changes are finished

if approching 5 hour limit, update these docs before doing anything else. add your current todo list to the bottom of the project_overview file  

for now read redesign_V2 as main work file for future sessions 

### session_history.md ###

read last 2 session to get context.

after that update on last session on start of new session

### a specific feature implamenteation doc ###

read all, and use as main update location during a task.

update after finishing major changes.

## task workflow ## 

general directive to major tasks, follow the order

## if apporching 5 hours limit 

- stop all development and update all docs with relevant info. 
- make a context dump to ne back on schedual. 
### show plan ### 

- read the task, if it makes sense, create todo.
- write a plan for me to approve if there are questions ask them now.
- update relevant doc to the feature, if theres no relevant doc ask for permission to make one.
- update todo.
- preform the agreed tasks. 
- report on terminal, focus on problems and unfinished tasks, emphasize source of problem.
- update doc when finished
