## general goal ## 

this is a doc meant to help us with integrating well on this project. 

updating the state of the project is massively important, and helps getting results that span multiple sessions.


## session workflow ## 

the goal is to get a good understanding of the enviroment in which the development will happen. to do this effectively the docs should be fairaly short, and give good info for the current session.

generally, when starting a session you will be directed to read these files:

### PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md ###

read always, update on finish and after major changes are finished



if approching 5 hour limit, update these docs before doing anything else. add your current todo list to the bottom of the project_overview file  

**if  asked to make a new file for a specific feature, use the SHIFT_IMPLAMENTATION_ISSUES as a template.**


### session_history.md ###

read last 2 session to get context.

after taht update on last session on start of new session

### a specific feature implamenteation doc ###

read all, and use as main update location during a task.

update after finishing major changes.

## task workflow ## 

general directive to major tasks, follow the order

### show plan ### 

- read the task, make todo 
- write a plan in the terminal 
- ask questions if there are any
- update relevant doc to the feature, if theres no relevant doc ask for permission to make one
- update todo 
- do the tasks 
- report on terminal, focus on problems and unfinished tasks   
- update doc when finished
