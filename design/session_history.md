### Session 24 - September 18, 2025

**Goals**: Complete suggestion system removal and fix role emulation system for V2 implementation

**Major Issues Discovered**:
- ❌ **V2 Role Emulation System Non-Functional**: Critical backend integration failures prevent role switching
- ❌ **Backend Function Recognition Issues**: Convex runtime not recognizing V2 functions despite correct implementation
- ❌ **Schema Validation Conflicts**: V2 user creation failing due to legacy field conflicts
- ❌ **Orphaned System References**: Deleted suggestion system causing persistent backend errors

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ **Complete Suggestions System Removal**: Successfully removed all suggestion-related functionality
  - Deleted suggestion box components, routes, and backend functions
  - Cleaned navigation to show only Home, Tool Rental, Courses, V1 Legacy
  - Removed suggestion imports and references throughout application
- ✅ **Role Emulator Rebuild**: Created new toggle-based role emulation system from scratch
  - Individual toggles for each role attribute (Staff Access, Worker Tag, Instructor Tag, Manager Tag, Rental Approved)
  - Business rule enforcement (Manager requires Worker tag)
  - Clean React-controlled dropdown with click-outside handling
  - Visual design with icons, descriptions, and proper styling
- ✅ **Dropdown Functionality Fix**: Resolved role emulator button interaction issues
  - Fixed DaisyUI vs React state management conflicts

  - Confirmed dropdown opens when button clicked
  - Validated toggle interface displays with correct options
  - Tested visual role display updates (Guest → Staff)

**Critical Unresolved Issues**:
1. **Backend Function Mapping Failure**:
   - RoleEmulator correctly calls `api.users_v2.switchV2Role`
   - Backend logs show `Could not find public function for 'users:switchEmulatingRole'` (wrong function name)
   - V2 function exists in users_v2.ts but Convex runtime not recognizing it
   - **Impact**: Role switching completely non-functional despite correct frontend implementation

2. **Schema Validation Errors**:
   - `ArgumentValidationError: Object contains extra field 'role' that is not in the validator`
   - V2 user creation functions rejecting objects with legacy `role` field
   - **Impact**: User authentication and data persistence failing

3. **Orphaned Reference Cleanup**:
   - TypeScript compilation errors for deleted suggestions.ts file persisting
   - Backend attempting to call non-existent suggestion functions
   - **Impact**: Build stability and runtime errors

4. **Role State Management Issues**:
   - Toggle switches show interaction but don't persist changes
   - UI reverts to guest state after apparent role switching
   - **Impact**: Testing and development workflow blocked

**Phase 1 Status Update**: Foundation is structurally complete but functionally broken due to backend integration failures. Critical fixes needed before V2 system can proceed.

**Session Outcome**: V2 role emulation system rebuilt with correct UI but backend integration completely non-functional. Significant debugging required for V2 system viability.

### Session 21 - September 13, 2025

**Goals**: Continue previous session work on shift positioning and complete calendar functionality

**Completed**:
- ✅ **CRITICAL SHIFT POSITIONING ALGORITHM FIX**: Resolved fundamental shift display issue
  - **Problem Identified**: User correctly pointed out shifts were displaying side-by-side when Morning and Evening shifts should stack vertically
  - **Root Cause**: Algorithm was giving each shift its own dedicated column instead of using proper time-overlap detection
  - **Solution**: Completely rewrote positioning logic to use standard overlap detection for ALL items (shifts and events)
  - **Result**: Morning Shift (09:00-13:00) and Evening Shift (15:00-19:00) now correctly share same column and stack vertically
  - **Technical Fix**: Full Day Shift (09:00-19:00) gets separate column due to time overlap with both other shifts
- ✅ **Calendar Backend Filter Restoration**: Fixed event display issues after debugging period
  - **Issue**: Events and tools weren't showing on calendar due to backend filters set to false during previous debugging
  - **Solution**: Changed default filters in calendar_unified.ts from disabled to enabled (showEvents: true, showTools: true)
  - **Result**: UI-controlled filtering now works correctly with backend showing all types by default
- ✅ **Documentation Consolidation**: United and cleaned up session planning documents  
  - **Action**: Combined NEXT_SESSION.md and NEXT_SESSION_TODO.md into single comprehensive file
