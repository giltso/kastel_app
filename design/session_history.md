**Part 1: i18n Translation Completion**

### Session 38 - October 20, 2025 (i18n Translation Completion - 100%)

**Goal**: Complete Hebrew translation for all remaining pages and modals (Tools, Educational, Roles)

**Major Achievements**:
- ✅ **Hebrew Translation Complete (100%)**: All user-facing components now fully translated
  - ✅ Fixed "Kastel" translation in common.json (קסטל with ק, not כ)
  - ✅ Fixed word order in app name: "קסטל חומרי בניין" (Kastel first)
  - ✅ Translated roles.tsx (100+ hardcoded strings discovered and fixed)
  - ✅ Translated CourseDetailsModal.tsx
  - ✅ Translated CreateCourseModal.tsx (690 lines)
  - ✅ Translated EnrollmentRequestModal.tsx
  - ✅ Translated CreateManualRentalModal.tsx (final modal)
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md to reflect 100% completion and testing phase
- ✅ **Deployed to Production**: All translations pushed and live on production

**Translation Statistics**:
- **Files Translated**: 5 major components (1 route page + 4 modals)
- **i18n Completion**: 100% (up from 85%)
- **Lines of Code Translated**: ~1,200 lines across all components
- **Commits Made**: 7 commits (one per component + documentation update)
- **Production Status**: Live and in user acceptance testing

**Technical Implementation**:
- **roles.tsx**: [src/routes/roles.tsx](../src/routes/roles.tsx)
  - Had zero i18n support - all hardcoded English strings
  - Added useLanguage hook and translated 100+ strings
  - All tabs, filters, badges, error messages, and actions translated
- **CourseDetailsModal**: [src/components/modals/CourseDetailsModal.tsx](../src/components/modals/CourseDetailsModal.tsx)
  - Translated all labels, status indicators, enrollment actions
- **CreateCourseModal**: [src/components/modals/CreateCourseModal.tsx](../src/components/modals/CreateCourseModal.tsx)
  - 690-line file with multi-step wizard
  - Translated step titles, form fields, validation messages, buttons
  - Used replace_all for efficiency on repeated patterns

  - Final remaining modal (283 lines)
  - Translated all form fields, placeholders, info alerts, buttons

**Pattern Used**:
1. Import `useLanguage` hook from `@/hooks/useLanguage`
2. Add `const { t } = useLanguage();` to component
3. Replace hardcoded strings with `t('namespace:key')`
4. Use existing translation files (already complete)

**Part 2: Browser Text Editing Feature Design**

**Major Achievements**:
- ✅ **Feature Design Complete**: Created comprehensive design document for browser-based content editing
  - ✅ Researched industry best practices (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi)
  - ✅ Designed database schema (`ui_content` table with multilingual support)
  - ✅ Designed component architecture (EditableText wrapper, inline editing)
  - ✅ Designed migration strategy (prevent file conflicts)
  - ✅ Planned 4-phase implementation (~11 hours total)
- ✅ **Created Feature Branch**: `feature/browser-text-editing`
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete design doc at [design/BROWSER_TEXT_EDITING.md](BROWSER_TEXT_EDITING.md)

**Feature Overview**:
Browser-based text editing system allowing managers to edit UI content (banners, help text, instructions) directly in the interface with multilingual support and translation tracking.

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Database storage** (industry standard - Convex `ui_content` table)
2. **Inline editing** with double-click activation (no modal)
3. **Global edit mode toggle** (manager-only, persists across pages)
4. **Multilingual support** (separate fields per language: `content_en`, `content_he`, etc.)
5. **Translation tracking** (auto-flag other languages as "needs translation" when one is edited)
6. **Single source of truth** (content lives in `ui_content.json` OR old files, never both)
7. **Click outside to save**, Escape to cancel
8. **Optimistic updates** for instant feedback

**Architecture Components**:
- **Database**: New `ui_content` table with multilingual fields and translation flags
- **Backend**: `convex/ui_content.ts` (saveUIContent, getUIContent mutations/queries)
- **Context**: `EditModeContext` for global edit mode state
- **Component**: `EditableText` wrapper with inline editing
- **Hook**: `useEditableContent` for database + fallback loading
- **Files**: New `public/locales/{lang}/ui_content.json` for defaults

**Implementation Phases** (11 hours total):
- Phase 1: Infrastructure (3h) - Database, backend, translation files, migration
- Phase 2: UI Components (4h) - EditableText component, edit mode toggle
- Phase 3: Integration (2h) - Wrap target UI elements across all pages
- Phase 4: Testing & Polish (2h) - Comprehensive testing, UX improvements

**Target Content** (editable UI elements):
- Info banners, help text, instructions
- Welcome messages, about sections
- Empty states, instructional text
- NOT business data (shift names, tool descriptions)

**Migration Strategy**:
- Move editable content from existing translation files to new `ui_content.json`
- Remove from old location to prevent conflicts
- Clear code distinction: `<EditableText>` = editable, `{t(...)}` = static

**Commits Made**:
- `docs: add comprehensive browser text editing feature design document`

**Branch Status**:
- ✅ Design complete
- ⏳ Implementation pending (future session)

**Next Session Priority**: Monitor user feedback on Hebrew translations, fix any RTL layout issues discovered during testing, or begin implementation of browser text editing feature.

**Status**: i18n translation work complete and in production testing. Browser text editing feature fully designed and ready for implementation.

### Session 27 - September 21, 2025

**Goals**: Fix Sunday-Saturday calendar format issues and implement week/month views for LUZ system

**Major Issues Discovered**:
- ❌ **User Reported Calendar Date Problems**: User claimed "today is sun 21, there are numerous problems that stem from the change to sun as the first day"
  - **Claimed Issue 1**: "on the month view it shows mon 22" - **INVESTIGATION RESULT**: Month view actually shows correct day (21)
  - **Claimed Issue 2**: "the week view it shows sun 20 and mon 21" - **INVESTIGATION RESULT**: Week view shows correct dates (Sun 21, Mon 22)
  - **Actual Issue Found**: Missing worker assignments display in week view containers
  - **Root Cause**: Week view only showed shift summaries but not individual worker assignments like daily view
- ❌ **Horizontal Timeline Removal Required**: User decided to completely remove horizontal timeline view from LUZ system
  - **Reason**: Decided to focus on daily vertical view instead of maintaining multiple timeline options
  - **Impact**: Required cleanup of imports, routes, and component references

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ **Week and Month View Implementation**: Successfully added comprehensive calendar views to LUZ system
  - ✅ LUZWeekView.tsx: 7-day horizontal grid with time-based positioning and shift display
  - ✅ LUZMonthView.tsx: Calendar-style monthly grid with event summary indicators
  - ✅ Updated getWeekDates() and getMonthDates() functions for Sunday-Saturday format
  - ✅ Integrated conditional queries to avoid unnecessary database calls
- ✅ **Horizontal Timeline Cleanup**: Completely removed LUZHorizontalTimeline.tsx and all references
  - ✅ Deleted component file and imports from luz.tsx route
  - ✅ Updated UI naming from "Vertical View" to "Daily View"
  - ✅ Cleaned up interface to remove timeline selection options
- ✅ **Worker Assignment Display Fix**: Added individual worker rendering in week view containers

  - ✅ Workers positioned and colored based on assignment status (confirmed vs pending)
  - ✅ Compact design with tooltips for full worker information

**Critical Unresolved Calendar Issues**:
1. **Date Calculation Discrepancy**:
   - **User Report**: Seeing wrong dates in calendar views
   - **Technical Reality**: Date calculations are mathematically correct (verified with node.js testing)
   - **Status**: UNRESOLVED - User perception vs technical implementation mismatch
   - **Investigation Needed**: Potential timezone, locale, or display formatting issues

2. **Calendar Library Settings Investigation**:
   - **User Request**: "maybe theres a seting in the react calander lib that pretains to start of week day"
   - **Investigation Result**: No external calendar library found - system uses custom JavaScript Date calculations
   - **Status**: COMPLETE - No systematic library settings available to configure

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- **Horizontal Timeline Removal**: Simplified LUZ interface to focus on three views: Daily (vertical), Week, Month
- **Sunday-Saturday Format**: Implemented across all calendar components with custom date generation functions
- **Worker Visualization**: Added compact worker assignment display in week view for consistency with daily view

**Problems and Limitations Identified**:
1. **User Interface Confusion**: Gap between user expectations and technical implementation for calendar dates
2. **No External Calendar Library**: System relies entirely on custom JavaScript Date logic, limiting configuration options
3. **Complex Date Generation**: Multiple functions (getWeekDates, getMonthDates, generateMonthGrid) need to stay synchronized
4. **Limited Configurability**: Week start day changes require code modifications rather than configuration

**Development Approach Issues**:
- **User Feedback Reliability**: User reported problems that technical investigation couldn't reproduce
- **Date/Time Complexity**: Calendar systems are inherently complex and prone to edge cases
- **Testing Challenges**: Need better tools for validating calendar calculations across different environments

**Next Session Requirements**:

   - Backend logs show `Could not find public function for 'users:switchEmulatingRole'` (wrong function name)
   - V2 function exists in users_v2.ts but Convex runtime not recognizing it
   - **Impact**: Role switching completely non-functional despite correct frontend implementation

2. **Schema Validation Errors**:
   - `ArgumentValidationError: Object contains extra field 'role' that is not in the validator`
   - V2 user creation functions rejecting objects with legacy `role` field
   - **Impact**: User authentication and data persistence failing

3. **Orphaned Reference Cleanup**:
   - TypeScript compilation errors for deleted suggestions.ts file persisting
   - Backend attempting to call non-existent suggestion functions
   - **Impact**: Build stability and runtime errors

4. **Role State Management Issues**:
   - Toggle switches show interaction but don't persist changes
   - UI reverts to guest state after apparent role switching
   - **Impact**: Testing and development workflow blocked

**Phase 1 Status Update**: Foundation is structurally complete but functionally broken due to backend integration failures. Critical fixes needed before V2 system can proceed.

### Session 21 - September 13, 2025

**Goals**: Continue previous session work on shift positioning and complete calendar functionality

**Completed**:
- ✅ **CRITICAL SHIFT POSITIONING ALGORITHM FIX**: Resolved fundamental shift display issue
  - **Problem Identified**: User correctly pointed out shifts were displaying side-by-side when Morning and Evening shifts should stack vertically
  - **Root Cause**: Algorithm was giving each shift its own dedicated column instead of using proper time-overlap detection
  - **Solution**: Completely rewrote positioning logic to use standard overlap detection for ALL items (shifts and events)
  - **Result**: Morning Shift (09:00-13:00) and Evening Shift (15:00-19:00) now correctly share same column and stack vertically
  - **Technical Fix**: Full Day Shift (09:00-19:00) gets separate column due to time overlap with both other shifts
- ✅ **Calendar Backend Filter Restoration**: Fixed event display issues after debugging period
  - **Issue**: Events and tools weren't showing on calendar due to backend filters set to false during previous debugging
  - **Solution**: Changed default filters in calendar_unified.ts from disabled to enabled (showEvents: true, showTools: true)
  - **Result**: UI-controlled filtering now works correctly with backend showing all types by default
- ✅ **Documentation Consolidation**: United and cleaned up session planning documents  
  - **Action**: Combined NEXT_SESSION.md and NEXT_SESSION_TODO.md into single comprehensive file
  - **Updates**: Removed outdated TODO file, updated session plan with current completion status
